"""
Data Preprocessing: Collect and preprocess student performance data, including features such as demographics, academic history, attendance records, etc.

Feature Engineering: Select relevant features and engineer new features if necessary to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate model architecture for pass rate prediction. You could use a neural network with multiple layers, such as a feedforward neural network or a recurrent neural network (RNN) if sequential data is involved.

Model Training: Split the data into training and validation sets. Train the model on the training data and tune hyperparameters using the validation set.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set to assess its performance in predicting student pass rates.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment where it can be used to predict student pass rates based on new data.
