Define the Generator: This neural network takes random noise as input and generates samples that resemble the training data.

Define the Discriminator: This neural network distinguishes between real data samples from the training set and fake samples generated by the generator.

Define Loss Functions: The generator aims to fool the discriminator, so its loss function encourages the generated samples to be classified as real. The discriminator's loss function encourages it to correctly classify real and fake samples.

Training Loop: In each iteration of training, you alternate between updating the discriminator to better distinguish real and fake samples and updating the generator to better fool the discriminator.
