## What is it?

```
Lambda functions are often used for short, simple operations where a full function definition would be overly verbose. 

Lambda functions are often used in situations where a short, throwaway function is needed, such as when passing a function as an argument to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), or sorted().

```

```
